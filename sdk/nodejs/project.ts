/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vercel from "@pulumiverse/vercel";
 *
 * // A project that is connected to a git repository.
 * // Deployments will be created automatically
 * // on every branch push and merges onto the Production Branch.
 * const withGit = new vercel.Project("withGit", {
 *     framework: "nextjs",
 *     gitRepository: {
 *         repo: "vercel/some-repo",
 *         type: "github",
 *     },
 * });
 * // A project that is not connected to a git repository.
 * // Deployments will need to be created manually through
 * // terraform, or via the vercel CLI.
 * const example = new vercel.Project("example", {framework: "nextjs"});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * If importing into a personal account, or with a team configured on the provider, simply use the project ID. - project_id can be found in the project `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import vercel:index/project:Project example prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 * ```
 *
 *  Alternatively, you can import via the team_id and project_id. - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI. - project_id can be found in the project `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import vercel:index/project:Project example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 * ```
